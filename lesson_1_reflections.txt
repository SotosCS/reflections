newHow did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was helpful for me to understand how diff works.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It can help me trace any bugs in my algorithms.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: They are logical commits
Cons: You may forget to commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they are related.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log will show me all the commits that have taken place whereas git diff will compare between two commits.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

version control.
